## Template and snippets ##
The template and snippets in [```cpp-code.snippets```](cpp-code.snippets) are for use with VSCode, Saving the file in ```.vscode``` folder in the workspace will make it available for all projects in the workspace. The snippets are for C++, and are heavily inspired(copied) from [as1605](https://github.com/as1605/) - read more here for understanding how to use them: [as1605/privateweb](https://github.com/as1605/privateweb/tree/master/setup)

## debugging.h ##
The [```debugging.h```](debugging.h) file is a header file for debugging purposes. It is taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/SansPapyrus683/61b65d4d7ec223b48ebf5c3bb382ba8d)

This is for my CP setup with VSCode, and might contain errors. If you find any, please let me know.
